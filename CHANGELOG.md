## 3.2.0

- Retries transport errors 'The stream was interrupted' and 'timeout waiting for response' within a budget of two continuations per Gemini round.
- Writes non-success Gemini results to `reports/<lane>-r<n>.partial.md` without overwriting full reports.
- Captures work lane reports from the last non-empty `agent_response` step instead of concatenating turn messages.
- Installs `cdx hook pre-tool` to deny review writes and `cdx hook pre-invocation` to inject in-turn steers via `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`.
- Emits structured review findings to `reports/<lane>-r<n>.findings.json` from `--json-schema`.
- Adds `cdx log <lane> [round] --transcript` to render Antigravity conversation transcripts from `transcriptPath`.
- Runs `cdx doctor` checks for the `hooks.json` entry, confirmed `/hooks` loading in agy, and configured model presence in `agy models`.
- Grants Gemini lanes tool access to web, browser, subagents, and MCP via the unconstrained agent file and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
